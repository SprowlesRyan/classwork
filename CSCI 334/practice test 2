1. The boosting algorithm is used to try and make a set of weak learners into a strong learner.
	The weak learners learn from the mistakes of other weak learners and don't make the mistakes
	that previous weak learners misclassified.
2. The bagging algorithm is used to improve stability and accuracy, but  it's main purpose is to
	reduce variance and help avoid overfitting.
