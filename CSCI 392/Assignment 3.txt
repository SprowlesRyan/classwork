Social Contract
Video games have a rating and most violent video games are rated either 
T or M, meaning you have to be 13 for the first 17 for the second. If someone
child is playing a game underage it is the fault of the parent in my opinion.

Violent video games and pornography are somewhat similar. They both attract
a certain type of person, and attraction can turn to addiction quickly. If 
everyone played violent video games then there are bound to be people who
take it too serious and think its okay to act that way in public. Video games 
can't compare to pornography in that way, but the way society views them is
similar to the pornography.

Violent video games involving children is not comparable to child pornography.
Child porography exploits children who don't know any better, violent video games
involving children don't exploit children.

Violent video games already have regulations placed on who can buy them. It is already
comparable to the way that pornography is viewed.
